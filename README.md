# Cinema Explorer

Cinema Explorer is a Movies App built with React, using the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

The app allows users to search for TV Shows, Movies, Directors, Actors, and more, based on their current location, as well as their language.
